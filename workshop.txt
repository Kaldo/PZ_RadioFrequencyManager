description=[h1]Sandbox options - predefined channels[/h1]
description=Now you can define specific channels in Sandbox Options and every newly created character will start with them already added to their RFM. These channels must be configured in a very specific way, the text field has a specific format that must be followed:
description=<frequency>;<channel name>
description=If you want to add more than one channel, it has to be separated from the previous one with the "|" symbol:
description=<frequency1>;<channel name1>|<frequency2>;<channel name2>|<frequency3>;<channel name3>
description=For example:
description=89.4;Hitz FM|93.2;LBMW - Kentucky Radio
description=This will result in creation of the Hitz FM on 89.4MHz, and LBMW - Kentucky radio on 93.2MHz.
